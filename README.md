## _Overview_
---
_Expense Tracker is a Python project that models and manages financial expenses using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.    
The project includes two main classes, `Expense` and `ExpenseDatabase`, which allow users to represent individual expenses and    
manage a collection of expenses efficiently._

---

## Expense Class
The `Expense` class represents an individual financial expense. It includes attributes such as a unique identifier, title, amount, and timestamps for creation and last update. 
The class also provides methods for initialization, updating, and converting the expense to a dictionary representation.

## ExpenseDatabase Class
The `ExpenseDatabase` class manages a collection of `Expense` objects. It includes methods for adding and removing expenses, retrieving expenses by ID or title, 
and converting the entire database to a list of dictionaries.
